If you are going to be using this as a JBOD to a server(not netapp). I have 3TB SAS Drives for $20each. 2TB SAS Drives for $10each.

Add Rail kit - $40each

Easiest way to attach this to your Dell/HP/supermicro/etc server is using a QSFP SFF-8436 Mini SAS SFF-8088 Cable which I have for $60. Else you can buy them for under $30 online

$200 cash (Firm). These sell for $345+shipping online(lots of forums of people using these).
